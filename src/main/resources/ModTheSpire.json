	"description": "Adds Beaked the Cultist as a new playable character. \n\nRecent Changes: \n- Fixed crash with Mimic Machine. \n- Fixed BleedPower not working. \n- Added attack effect for Taskmaster's Torture. \n- Sentries Pulse no longer removes UnawakenedPower (as removing it does nothing). \n\n- Week 46 compatibility. \n- Added a new card, Know Thy Foe, as well as the 9 cards it can spawn.\n- Added a new class specific potion: Ritual Potion.\n- Huntress/Machine/Warrior Spirit now interact with Awakened Form properly (IE: give negative Strength if the card's cost is negative).\n- Added a bit more delay to Crazy Rituals to make it easier to follow.\n- The Easter egg interaction no longer uses actions, so it shouldn't slow down playing cards anymore.\n\nIf you contributed and don't see your name in the credits, please let us know!",
